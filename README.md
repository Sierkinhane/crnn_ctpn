# Crnn_Ctpn_Unified #
Unified text detection and recognition

First of all, thanks for the author of crnn and ctpn algorithm with opening their codes.
Here is [crnn](https://github.com/meijieru/crnn.pytorch) original codes, here is [ctpn](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/CTPN) original codes and a tensorflow version can be found [here](https://github.com/eragonruan/text-detection-ctpn)

## In my repository, ctpn is built by tensorflow, meanwile crnn is built by pytorch
## Environment 
 tensorflow-gpu(version>=1.6)
 pytorch(version>=0.3)
warp-ctc [click here to download](https://github.com/SeanNaren/Warp-ctc)
Just using pip to establish your dev environment, eg. pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.6, pip install torchvesion(it will install pytorch meanwhile)
